# üî∞ VERSION 1.16.5

I decide to skip that version in favor of
[Embeddium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium-extras) by PotatoBoy (aka TexTure).
It Is too good like Embeddium++, Shares features and has more Performance fixes and features.

# ‚è© THE FUTURE OF EMBEDDIUM++

Before I place some jokes, but this time I am 100% sure. 
All [Sodium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-extra) will be added
onto Embeddium++, making OBSOLETE some ports of it like Rubidium (Embeddium) Extra.

Create the first API around Sodium config page and include some misc optimization options like Cull Leaves
and quality features like Shadow Path Blocks

Enviddium (Nvidium port) will be a separated mod; I don't think it is a good idea to add it on embeddium++.
You can speed porting donating me, so I can afford a second-hand GTX 1660), you cannot, and anyway, I'll do it :)

Sodium++ will exist... *soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è*
