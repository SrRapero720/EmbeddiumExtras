Mod who gives you a plus for embeddium And a reliable fork of [MagnesiumExtras](https://github.com/anthxnymc/MagnesiumExtras)
(and now is embedded [DynamicLights](https://github.com/anthxnymc/DynamicLightsReforged))

## FEATURES
- Embedded DynamicLights (works better with shaders)
- True Darkness (ideal for terror modpacks)
- Entity Distance Rendering Limit (or EntityCulling for friends)
- Fancy FPS Counter (No more F3 to see your FPS)
- Borderless FullScreen (tab faster)
- Fog Toggle (Disable game fog)
- Hide JEI overlay when you are not searching (this time disabled by default)
- ~~ZommKey~~ (removed in favor of [JustZoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-zoom-forge))
- ~~Chunk Fade In~~ (Missing)
