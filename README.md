# EMBEDDIUM++
Mod who gives you a plus for embeddium
And a reliable fork of [MagnesiumExtras](https://github.com/anthxnymc/MagnesiumExtras) (now with [DynamicLights](https://github.com/anthxnymc/DynamicLightsReforged))

## FEATURES
- DynamicLights Feature (works better with shaders)
- True Darkness (ideal for terror modpacks)
- Entity Distance Rendering Limit (or EntityCulling for friends)
- Fancy FPS Counter (No more F3 to see your FPS)
- Borderless Fullscreen (tab faster)
- Fog Toggle (Disable game fog)
- Hide JEI overlay when you are not searching (this time disabled by default)
- ~~ZommKey~~ (removed in favor of [JustZoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-zoom-forge))
- ~~Chunk Fade In~~ (Missing)

## DIFFERENCES WITH OFFICIAL VERSION
- Fixed: Ice and Fire dragons got culled
- Fixed: you can't go back to Windowed after switching into Borderless/FullScreen
- Implemented: fast entities whitelist to be ignored on culling (supports wildcard for name)
- Implemented: Gui configurations are now localized (help translating [here](https://igthub.com/SrRapero720/EmbeddiumPlus/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/embeddiumplus/lang/en_us.json))
- Misc: Code cleanup and optimization
- Misc: More stuff that I forgot :(
